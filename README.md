# Image generation using a Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network

This project explores image generation using a DCGAN, the MNIST dataset was used for training this system. 
The model's architecture was inspired by Radford et al.'s 2016 paper " Unsupervised Representation Learning with Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks"
